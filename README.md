# dotfiles
My vim scripts, macros and plugins that have accumulated over the years
I have tried to keep it as minimal as possible, with mainly support for C++ and python from language servers
Although I use only a few files from this repo in every day use, I have kept others in case I need to switch

This heavily relies on vim-plug : https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
